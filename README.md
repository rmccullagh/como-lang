# como-lang
my experiment in building an AST, dynamic interpreted language. The executing of the AST happens in function `ex` which is located
in (ast_compile.c)[https://github.com/rmccullagh/como-lang/blob/master/ast_compile.c]. If somehow you have landed here and are interested in
building this, then you need `bison`, `flex`, `libobject`, and `libeasyio` 

You should know that this isn't a useful language. It was meant as personal educational project to learn about Abstract Syntax Tree, and grammar.
